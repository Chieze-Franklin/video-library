## Getting Started

The project is set up as a monorepo, with both the backend and frontend existing in the same repo.
We achieve this by taking advantage of Yarn's built-in support for monorepos.

To get started run the following commands in the root directory:

- `yarn install` to install all dependencies

## Running the Application

### Backend

To run the backend server:

- Run `yarn dev` in the _packages/backend/_ directory OR
- Run `yarn dev:backend` in the root directory

The backend server will be accessible at `localhost:3000`.

### Frontend

To run the frontend server:

- Run `yarn dev` in the _packages/frontend/_ directory OR
- Run `yarn dev:frontend` in the root directory

The backend server will be accessible at `localhost:8080`.
